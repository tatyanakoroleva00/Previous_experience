This is my first site that I did with a YouTube-programmer (step by step). I have managed to get to know smth new:

tinypng.com - to make a photo size smaller with no reduction of the quality
@2x - to add this to the name of the photo that has a size twice more than the original one.
Button and Button with the link. The first is if there is an action happenning at the same page. The second is for an action happenning at some other page.
src set - for a picture with different sizes
and
+ classes to mention in every paragraph

headings are important for the semantical sence
SHIFT+TAB to move the block to the left / TAB - to the right (in HTML)

Here, I have my first experiences with HTML, CSS, JS
1. Chess, I was trying to positing the game in the center, so that I could have a sort of a simulation of a choice (color change - :hover); 
2. My first website, created in 2021, after several months of HTML, CSS studying. 
3. Forms practicing. I was practicing with different forms, so that to understand what kind of forms exist and how easy it is to create them. 
4. Watch website. I was repeating after a YouTube blogger, trying to create the same website as he had in Figma. 
5. Oxford website. It was my first try of such website with lists, text on the picture, container, of a narrow website. 
6. Travel website. It was my first try of such site with buttons, images in rows and columns, of a wide website.

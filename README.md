Here, I have my first experiences with HTML, CSS, JS
1. Chess, I was trying to positing the game in the center, so that I could have a sort of a simulation of a choice (color change - :hover); 
2. My first website, created in 2021, after several months of HTML, CSS studying. 
3. Forms practicing. I was practicing with different forms, so that to understand what kind of forms exist and how easy it is to create them. 
4. Watch website. I was repeating after a YouTube blogger, trying to create the same website as he had in Figma.
